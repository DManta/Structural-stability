# Structural-stability

This program performs the structural stability of a structure, namely:
* Calculates the non-linear load-displacement path, by Newton-Raphson method;
* Plot the load-displacement graph;
* Plot the deformed configurations;
* Plot the heat map of stresses/strains;

## Application example
Consider the structure on figure 1
